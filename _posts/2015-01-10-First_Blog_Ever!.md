It is the start of the 2015 new year, and I anticipate this year to be a great one!

So to start off, I'm making my very first blog! (Am I considered a blogger now?) 

I hope to turn this into a habit to write about my
thoughts and discoveries relating to Computer Science/Computer Engineering at least once a week. 

My New Year's List of Resolutions:

1. Code something at least once a day, regardless of how stressed I am.
2. Make a post on my blog at least once a week, possibly detailing the things I've coded and learned.
3. Read more books (PDF's, let's be honest)
